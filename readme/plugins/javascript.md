# Javascript Plugin Manual  
  
## Quick Overview  
  
The Javascript Plugin targets RPG Maker MV and MZ Javascript (.js) files, along with any other Javascript files from any other games.  
It supports all string literals along with regexes.  
For context, String Groups are named with the function name of where the string is located.  
  
RPG Maker MV and MZ `plugins.js` files are processed differently, almost as a JSON file. Each plugin settings are extracted as Virtual Files, for clarity sake.
