## Quick Overview  
  
The YBN plugin targets YBN script files from the YU-RIS Engine (usually named yst00000.ybn).  
It requires to have been extracted by the YPF plugin to work properly.  
  
## About Patches  
  
YU-RIS games will read files from the `ybin` folder found in the game directory.  
Example:  
```console
Game Folder/
├── ybin/ ← Patched files generated by RPGMTL
├── pac/ysbin.ypf ← Where the archive was originally, no need to touch it.
└── game.exe
```  
So, if you wish to test or distribute a patch, make sure to but the `ybin` folder at the root of the game folder.
