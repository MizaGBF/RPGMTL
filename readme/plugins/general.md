## Quick Overview  
  
The General Plugin doesn't actually target any file.  
Instead, it provides utility File Actions.  
Currently:  
- `Check the Character Limit`: Check if a string in the current file is over the Character Limit setting, and mark it as modified.  
- `Clear the Modified String indicators`: Clear the modified flag of all strings in the current file.
