## Translating Unity games  
  
Unity Games aren't officialy supported by RPGMTL, due to how difficult it would be to extract and patch the strings.  
However, one way to work around this limitation, is to use [XUnity Auto Translator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator) on the game, play it as throughly as possible, then import it into RPGMTL.  
The content of _AutoGeneratedTranslations.txt can then be imported and edited, along with other supported files.
