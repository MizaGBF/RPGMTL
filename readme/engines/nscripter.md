## Translating NScripter games  
  
Refer to the nscripter.md plugin manual for details.  
We recommend using the plugin with the Single-byte mode enabled, combined with [ONScripter](https://github.com/Galladite27/ONScripter-EN).  
Simply use the ONScripter-EN executable, maybe a default font and your patched file(s).
