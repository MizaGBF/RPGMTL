Future (possible) improvements or bugs are noted here:  
  
## Planning Stage  
  
### Security / Navigation  
- [ ] Add some sort of authentification (with a Command line parameter to set a password?).  
  
### UI / QoL  
  
- [ ] Add a built-in note system.  
- [ ] A comment system for each line could be nice too.  
- [ ] Add more settings to string search and replace strings.  
- [x] Add some feedback if a fix fails.
  
### Translator
  
- [ ] Rework the different TranslatorPlugin type into something cleaner.
