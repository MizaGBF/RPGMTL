## Planning Stage  
  
### Security / Navigation  
- None
  
### UI / QoL  
  
- [ ] Add a built-in note/comment system.  
- [ ] Add a way (shortcut?) to toggle strings accross all files.  
- [ ] A comment system for each line could be nice too.  
- [X] A general tool/action page, with perhaps a way for plugins to register their own.  
  
### Translator
