Future (possible) improvements or bugs are noted here:  
  
## Planning Stage  
  
### Security / Navigation  
- [ ] Add some sort of authentification (with a Command line parameter to set a password?).  
- [X] Add support for URLSearchParams to bookmark specific pages and support a browse back/forward inputs.  
- [x] Add fallback when using main page "last accessed files" if the file or project has been deleted.  
- [X] Opening a file after a string search not letting you go back to the search.  
- [ ] Open search results, using the search button in the translation area, in another tab (Will require better navigation first).  
  
### Logic  
  
- [x] Rework or improve the translation completion computation system.  
  
### UI / QoL  
  
- [ ] Add a built-in note system.  
- [ ] A comment system for each line could be nice too.
