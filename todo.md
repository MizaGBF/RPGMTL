Future (possible) improvements or bugs are noted here:  
  
## Planning Stage  
  
### Security / Navigation  
- [ ] Add some sort of authentification (with a Command line parameter to set a password?).  
  
### UI / QoL  
  
- [ ] Add a built-in note system.  
- [ ] A comment system for each line could be nice too.  
  
### Translator
  
- [x] Make it possible to select different translator for single and batle translations.  
- [ ] Let Translator plugins optionally different format for translations (especially for batch translation, to have context for AI uses).
