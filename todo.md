Future (possible) improvements are noted here:  
  
## Planning Stage  
  
### Security / Navigation  
- [ ] Add some sort of authentification (with a Command line parameter to set a password?).  
- [ ] Add support for URLSearchParams to bookmark specific pages and support a browse back/forward inputs.  
- [ ] Add fallback when using main page "last accessed files" if the file or project has been deleted.  
- [ ] Add "last accessed files" on project page. Perhaps increase the limit too.  
  
### Logic  
  
- [ ] Rework or improve the translation completion computation system.  
  
### UI / QoL  
  
- [ ] Add a built-in note system.  
- [ ] A comment system for each line could be nice too.  
- [ ] Add the occurence count of an original string when selected.  
  
## Testing Stage  
  
None.
